## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#3 read all the ish in
county <- read_csv("Downloads/county.csv")

election2016 <- read_csv("Downloads/election2016.csv")

election2012 <- read_csv("Downloads/election2012.csv")

##merging
combined <- merge(county, election2016, by="FIPS")

superCombined<- merge(combined, election2012, by="FIPS")

summary(superCombined)
## basic regression + plots for 3 variables

##race
fit <-lm(superCombined$pct_non_white15 ~ superCombined$votes_dem_16)

plot(superCombined$pct_non_white15, superCombined$votes_dem_16, main="race")

##education
fit2 <-lm(superCombined$pct_bach_deg15 ~ superCombined$votes_dem_16 )

plot(superCombined$pct_bach_deg15, superCombined$votes_dem_16, main="education")

##foreign born
fit3 <- lm(superCombined$pct_for_born15 ~ superCombined$votes_dem_16)

plot(superCombined$pct_for_born15 ~ superCombined$votes_dem_12)

swingStates <- subset(superCombined$state.x == c("FL","NV","CO", "IA","MI","MN", "OH", "NH", "NC","PA","VA","WI"))

summary(fit)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
